CodePath Simple ToDo App

This is an Android demo application for creating and editing a simple TODO tasks. 

Completed user stories:

Required: successfully add and remove items

Required: support persistent todo items

(Suggested) Persist the todo items into SQLite instead of a text file

(Suggested) Improve style of the todo items in the list using a custom adapter

(Suggested) Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)

Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds
Notes:

I spent a bit of time trying to customize the action bar with color themes/styles and the launcher icon, but to no avail! I am going to port this app to my phone to see if the emulator has issues.
